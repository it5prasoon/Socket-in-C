<ul>
<li>Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. </li>
<li>Sockets are low level endpoint used for processing information across network</li>
<li>One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection.</li>
